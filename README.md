# guessing-bot
A two mode number guessing CLI game

Option 1 allows the bot to guess your number, type one in and it will think for a few seconds until it guesses it correct every time

Option 2 gives you the chance to try to guess what number it thinks of, you only have 2 chances for each try, and its thinking of a number between 0 and 1000

Guess it's number right and you will be given an amazing reward
